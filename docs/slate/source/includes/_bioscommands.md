## BIOS commands

This section details usage and examples of RESTful Interface Tool commands related to configuring BIOS settings. These commands do things such as view and change the boot order, reset the BIOS configuration to the default settings, and configure iSCSI settings.

### Bootorder command

> Bootorder example commands:

> In this example, the boot order was not specified first. The current persistent boot order is listed. Other options, such as continuous and one time boot options, as well as continuous and one time boot UEFI options are also displayed. Next, we call bootorder with a specified list. This sets the boot order to **Generic.USB.1.1, HD.EmbRAID.1.3., NIC.LOM.1.1.Httpv4, HD.SD.1.2, NIC.LOM.1.1.IPV4, NIC.LOM.1.1.Httpv6, NIC.LOM.1.1.IPv6, HD.EmbRAID.1.5, HD.EmbRAID1.6, HD.EmbRAID.1.4, HD.EmbRAID1.2**. The commit flag will commit the changes, otherwise changes are not saved.

> ![Bootorder Example 1](images/examples/bootorder_ex1.png "Bootorder example 1")


> Here the one time boot order was changed so that the next time the server boots it will boot from the hard drive.

> ![Bootorder Example 2](images/examples/bootorder_ex2.png "Bootorder example 2")


> Here the continuous boot option was changed so that it will keep attempting to boot from the cd drive.

> ![Bootorder Example 3](images/examples/bootorder_ex3.png "Bootorder example 3")


> To turn off any continuous or one-time boot options that have been configured, include the disablebootflag option.

#### Syntax

bootorder *[Boot Order] [Optional Parameters]*

#### Description

Run this command without arguments to display current boot order. Otherwise, run it with commands to change the order of booting, to perform a one-time boot, to perform a continuous bout, or disable continuous boot or one-time boot options.

#### Parameters

- **Boot Order**

The boot order can be specified as a list of numbers. If omitted, displays the current boot order. See examples below for usage and syntax.

- **-h, --help**

Including the help flag on this command will display help on the usage of this command.

Use this flag to enable a continuous boot option. Using this flag will cause the system to boot to the selected device every time the system boots.

- **--disablebootflag**

Use this to disable either continuous or one-time boot modes.

> ![iSCSIConfig Example 1](images/examples/iscsi_ex1.png "iSCSIConfig example 1")

> Use the list flag to retrieve the current configured iscsi boot attempts. If none are configured, as seen above, then you will see all sections with a message stating **Not Added**.

> ![iSCSIConfig Example 2](images/examples/iscsi_ex2.png "iSCSIConfig example 2")

> The add [2] flag was included here to add a boot attempt. The [2] entry here causes the server to add a boot attempt with the **iSCSINicSource NicBoot** value of 2. Thus, the [2] supplied here caused a new entry to be added with **iSCSINicSource** value **NicBoot2**. 

<aside class="notice">
The 2 inputted here is not the attempt number, as opposed to "iscsiconfig --delete 2" which does *delete the 2nd boot attempt.*
</aside>

> ![iSCSIConfig Example 3](images/examples/iscsi_ex3.png "iSCSIConfig example 3")


> Here we first added a boot attempt, then decided to modify some properties. We do this by first writing the **iscsiconfig** properties to a file called **output.txt** using the â€“f flag. 

<aside class="notice">
The results are only written to the file if the --list flag is included as well.
</aside>

> ![iSCSIConfig Example 4-1](images/examples/iscsi_ex4-1.png "iSCSIConfig example 4-1")

> ![iSCSIConfig Example 4-2](images/examples/iscsi_ex4-2.png "iSCSIConfig example 4-2")

> ![iSCSIConfig Example 5-1](images/examples/iscsi_ex5-1.png "iSCSIConfig example 5-1")


> Then we opened up the output.txt file in a word processor, changed the property we wanted to, and re-uploaded the configuration to the server using the modify flag. Since second-level BIOS authentication was required, the biospassword flag was included as well. The original and modified output.txt files are given above, with the iSCSITargetInfoViaDHCP value changed from true to false. The original and modified output.txt files are given above, with the iSCSITargetInfoViaDHCP value changed from true to false.

> Here when the server was logged into, there was already a boot attempt configured. To delete a boot attempt, use the delete flag to remove the boot attempt. We then verified that the boot attempt was deleted with another list flag. 

<aside class="notice">
The "iscsiconfig --delete 1" command deletes the 1st iSCSI attempt. This is different from the number specified with "iscsiconfig --add [1]", which implies add an iSCSI attempt with **NicBoot1**.
</aside>
